"""User-friendly class to generate stochastic block model graphs with features.

A stochastic block model is a random graph model that defines edge probabilities
based on "blocks" to which nodes are assigned. The set of blocks is a disjoint
and exhaustive partition of the nodes. The likelihood of this model is often
used in algorithms to estimate community structure in graphs. The model is also
used as a generative model for producing graphs with community structure. This
class is for the latter use-case, and uses graph_tool.generation.generate_sbm
under-the-hood, but has an interface with a more standard set of parameters. The
implementation of the package simulator is optimized, but still can be slow for
graphs with a large number of edges.

This class also includes functionality to generate node features with varying
correlation to the blocks, which is useful for benchmarking graph convolutional
neural networks (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16904).
